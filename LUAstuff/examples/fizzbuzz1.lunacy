-- Fizz buzz problem:
-- If a number is evenly divisible by 15, say "fizz buzz"
-- Otherwise, numbers evenly divisible by three become "fizz"
-- Numbers evenly divisible by five become "buzz"
-- Otherwise, show the number

for a = 1, 100, 1 do -- Go from 1 to 100, increment by 1
  if a % 15 == 0 then print("fizz buzz")
  elseif a % 3 == 0 then print("fizz")
  elseif a % 5 == 0 then print("buzz")
  else print(a) end
end

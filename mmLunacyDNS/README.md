# mmLunacyDNS

mmLunacyDNS is a simple DNS server configured with Lunacy, my fork of
Lua 5.1 (the syntax is the same)

It uses, as a Lua configuration file, `mmLunacyDNS.lua` by default.
It is possible to use a different config file by either:

* Renaming the `mmLunacyDNS` binary to another name.
* By specifying a config file with the `-d` option:

```
	mmLunacyDNS -d /etc/mmLunacyDNS.lua
```

Here, the `-d` option means "debug": Do not run `mmLunacyDNS` as a 
daemon.  Right now, `mmLunacyDNS` does not have built-in daemonization
support, so it *must* have the `-d` option to run.  If one is using the
`mmLunacyDNS.lua` file in the same location as the `mmLunacyDNS` binary
as the configuration file, it can be run as follows:

```
	mmLunacyDNS -d
```

The configuration file, which *always* has the suffix `.lua`, tells
mmLunacyDNS the IP to bind to, and has a Lua function which is called
every time a DNS query is received.

The script `compile.mmLunacyDNS.sh` compiles mmLunacyDNS and links it
to Lunacy (Lua).

`mmLunacyDNS` currently has no UNIX/BSD/Linux daemonization support (but
it can be made a daemon with `Duende` included with MaraDNS).  It does, 
however, install and run as a Windows service; a binary is in the
top-level `bin/` folder (see the "Windows binary" section below).

# Configuration file format

mmLunacyDNS uses a Lua script as a configuration file.

From that file, it gets the string `bindIp`, which is the IP 
mmLunacyDNS binds to.  `bindIp` is a top-level global variable.

Once it binds to the IP, every time mmLunacyDNS gets a query, it
runs the lua function processQuery, which takes as its input a
table with two members:

* `mmQuery`: This is the DNS name requested, in the form of a string
  like `caulixtla.com.` or `samiam.org.` (observe the dot at the end of 
  the mmQuery string).  If the string has anything besides an ASCII 
  letter, an ASCII number, the `-` character (dash), or the `_` 
  character (underline), the character will be a two-digit hexadecimal 
  number in brackets.  If we get the raw UTF-8 query `Ã±.samiam.org` 
  (where the first character is a n with a tilde), mmQuery will look 
  like `{c3}{b1}.samiam.org.`.
* `mmQtype`: The is the numeric DNS query type requested.  This is a number
  between 0 and 65535, and corresponds to the DNS query type made.  A
  list of DNS query type numbers is available at
  https://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-parameters/dns-parameters.xhtml
  1 is "A", i.e. a request for an IPv4 IP address.

The processQuery function returns as its output a table with two
parameters:

* `mm1Type`: This right now has to be the string `A`, or the DNS query is
  ignored
* `mm1Data`: This is an IPv4 IP in dotted decimal format, e.g. `10.1.2.3`

# Examples

```lua
-- We bind to the IP 127.0.0.1 and always return "10.1.2.3" for every
-- DNS query we get
bindIp = "127.0.0.1"
function processQuery(mmAll)
  return {mm1Type = "A", mm1Data="10.1.2.3"}
end
```

Here is a more complex example, where *.com gets 10.1.1.1 and anything else
gets 10.1.2.3, non-A queries are ignored, and we log A queries:

```lua
bindIp = "127.0.0.1" -- We bind the server to the IP 127.0.0.1
function processQuery(mmAll) -- Called for every DNS query received
  if mmAll.mmQtype ~= 1 then -- If it is not an A (ipv4) query
    return {mm1Type = "ignoreMe"} -- Ignore the query
  end
  mmDNS.log("Got IPv4 query for " .. mmAll.mmQuery) -- Log the query
  if string.match(mmAll.mmQuery,'.com.$') then
    return {mm1Type = "A", mm1Data = "10.1.1.1"} -- Answer for anything.com
  end
  return {mm1Type = "A", mm1Data = "10.1.2.3"} -- Answer for anything not .com
end
```

# Sandboxing

mmLunacyDNS provides some level of protection from untrusted `.lua` 
configuration files.  It is run in sandbox mode: All top-level
functions (such as `require`) are not present.  In addition, libraries
which can affect other files (such as `io` or `lfs`) are not here.  
What *is* present are three libraries for manipulating data: `string`,
`math`, and a mostly complete implementation of `bit32`.

To make up for there not being a `print` method, `mmDNS.log` can
be called instead; note that `mmDNS.log` only takes a single string
argument.

# Windows binary

In the `bin/` folder, there is a Windows binary of mmLunacyDNS available.
This is a service for Windows computers.  To install the service,
as an administrator, do the following:

```
	mmLunacyDNS.exe --install
	net start mmLunacyDNS
```

The mmLunacyDNS.exe file will use, as a configuration file, 
`mmLunacyDNS.lua` in the same location `mmLunacyDNS.exe` is 
located.  Messages will be logged in the file `mmLunacyDNSLog.txt`,
again in the same location as `mmLunacyDNS.exe`.

To stop the service:

```
	net stop mmLunacyDNS
```

It will take about two seconds to stop the mmLunacyDNS service.

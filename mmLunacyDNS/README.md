# mmLunacyDNS

mmLunacyDNS is a wrapper which uses Lua to set up a simple DNS server.

The file `mmLunacyDNS.lua` is read to get the IP to bind to and the
IP to return.

The script `compile.mmLunacyDNS.sh` compiles mmLunacyDNS and links it
to Lunacy (Lua).

mmLunacyDNS has no daemonization support.

The Lua configuration file is an unstable API and may change.
